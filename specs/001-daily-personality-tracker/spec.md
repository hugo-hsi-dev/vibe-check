# Feature Specification: Daily Personality Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-daily-personality-tracker`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build me a personality tracker app. It will follow a similar format to the popular 16 personalities online quiz. It will follow MBTI standards, just like the original website. Where my app deviates is how the user interacts with the quiz. Unlike 16 personality's one time quiz, my app (vibe-check) will allow the user to answer short 3 questions quizzes each day to grasp a more long term picture of the individual's personality. We will track user's personality deviations over time, giving the end user interesting data that the original website would be unable to give due to its nature. From the admin side, I will be able to edit, create, and delete from a pool of questions. The questions will have 'agree' and 'disagree' answer choices only. I want to decrease the amount of friction of completing a day's quiz and encourage users to use it long term."

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17 - Simplified quiz to only agree/disagree options (removed neutral)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Daily Quiz Completion (Priority: P1)

A user visits the app once per day to answer a quick 3-question personality quiz. The questions are presented one at a time with simple agree/disagree options. After completing all 3 questions, they see their current personality type and a brief confirmation that their response was recorded.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition and the primary user interaction. Without this working, the app delivers no value. It represents the MVP - a user can take daily quizzes and get immediate personality feedback.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a user account, accessing the daily quiz, answering 3 questions with any combination of agree/disagree, and receiving a personality type result. Delivers value by providing immediate personality assessment feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has logged in and hasn't taken today's quiz, **When** they visit the home page, **Then** they see the first of 3 questions with agree/disagree buttons
2. **Given** a user is answering a quiz question, **When** they select an answer, **Then** the next question appears immediately without page reload
3. **Given** a user completes all 3 questions, **When** they submit the final answer, **Then** they see their current personality type (e.g., "INTJ") and a success message
4. **Given** a user has completed today's quiz, **When** they visit the app again the same day, **Then** they see a message indicating they've already completed today's quiz and can return tomorrow
5. **Given** it's a new day (after midnight), **When** a returning user logs in, **Then** they see a new set of 3 questions

### User Story 2 - Personality Trend Visualization (Priority: P2)

After completing quizzes for at least 3 days, a user can view their personality trends over time. They see a timeline or chart showing how their personality type has changed or remained stable, along with insights about which dimensions (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) show the most variation.

**Why this priority**: This is the key differentiator from 16 personalities. It provides the long-term value that keeps users engaged. However, it requires multiple days of data, so P1 must work first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating multiple days of quiz completion (using test data or date manipulation), then viewing the trends page to see personality type changes over time. Delivers value by showing users unique insights they cannot get from single-assessment personality tests.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has completed quizzes for at least 3 days, **When** they navigate to the "My Trends" page, **Then** they see a visual representation of their personality types over time
2. **Given** a user is viewing their trends, **When** they hover over or tap on a specific date, **Then** they see the personality type result for that day and which questions they answered
3. **Given** a user has personality data spanning multiple weeks, **When** they view trends, **Then** they see which MBTI dimensions (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) are most stable vs. most variable
4. **Given** a user has completed fewer than 3 quizzes, **When** they try to access trends, **Then** they see a message encouraging them to complete more daily quizzes to unlock trends

### User Story 3 - User Account Management (Priority: P1)

A new user can create an account with email and password, log in to access their quiz history, and maintain their personality data across sessions and devices.

**Why this priority**: Without accounts, users cannot track their personality over time (the core value). This is P1 because it's foundational infrastructure for the main feature, though it can be tested independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new account, logging out, logging back in, and verifying that quiz history persists. Delivers value by enabling the core use case of long-term personality tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new visitor, **When** they click "Sign Up", **Then** they see a form requesting email and password
2. **Given** a user fills out the signup form with valid email and password, **When** they submit, **Then** their account is created and they are logged in automatically
3. **Given** a user has an existing account, **When** they enter correct credentials on the login page, **Then** they are logged in and see their dashboard
4. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they log out and log back in, **Then** their previous quiz history and personality data are still accessible
5. **Given** a user enters an invalid email format or weak password, **When** they attempt to sign up, **Then** they see clear validation error messages

---

### User Story 4 - Admin Question Management (Priority: P3)

An admin user can log in to an admin panel where they can view all questions in the question pool, create new questions (specifying which MBTI dimension they measure), edit existing questions, and delete questions. Each question is associated with one MBTI dimension (E/I, S/N, T/F, or J/P) and has agree/disagree response options.

**Why this priority**: This enables content management but isn't essential for initial launch if a starter set of questions is pre-loaded. It's important for long-term maintainability but P1-P3 can function without it initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as an admin, creating a new question associated with a specific MBTI dimension, editing an existing question, deleting a question, and verifying that end users see the updated question pool in their daily quizzes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin is logged in, **When** they navigate to the admin panel, **Then** they see a list of all questions in the pool with their associated MBTI dimensions
2. **Given** an admin clicks "Create New Question", **When** they fill out the question text and select an MBTI dimension, **Then** the new question is added to the pool
3. **Given** an admin clicks "Edit" on an existing question, **When** they modify the text and save, **Then** the changes are persisted and future quizzes use the updated text
4. **Given** an admin clicks "Delete" on a question, **When** they confirm the deletion, **Then** the question is removed from the pool and won't appear in future quizzes
5. **Given** an admin attempts to create a question without selecting an MBTI dimension, **When** they try to save, **Then** they see a validation error

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user starts a quiz but doesn't complete it (closes browser mid-quiz)? Should their partial progress be saved, or should they start fresh next time?
- How does the system handle timezone differences? If a user travels across timezones, which timezone determines "a new day" for quiz availability?
- What feedback does the user receive during data loading when viewing trends (loading states, skeleton screens)?
- How are validation errors communicated during signup (inline vs. summary at top)?
- What happens on network failure or timeout during quiz submission? Is the quiz response saved locally and retried, or does the user need to retake it?
- What happens when there aren't enough questions in the pool to generate a 3-question quiz without repeating recently asked questions?
- Can users see questions they've answered before, or should the system ensure variety over time?

## Assumptions

- Users have basic familiarity with MBTI personality types (or will learn through using the app)
- Users are motivated to track their personality over time and will return daily
- A starting question pool of 40+ questions will be pre-loaded before launch
- Admin access is restricted to the product team (not self-service admin registration)
- Users access the app primarily via web browser (responsive design for mobile and desktop)
- All timestamps use UTC to avoid timezone complexity in MVP
- Users understand that agree/disagree responses don't have "right" answers
- Personality type calculation uses standard MBTI scoring methodology (cumulative dimension scores)
- Quiz questions are language-agnostic or presented in English initially
- Users can only see their own personality data (no social features or comparisons with others in MVP)

## Out of Scope

- Social features (comparing personality types with friends, sharing results)
- Detailed personality descriptions beyond the 4-letter type
- Premium features or paid subscriptions
- Mobile native apps (web-only MVP)
- Multi-language support
- Email reminders or notifications to complete daily quiz
- Personality-based recommendations or content
- Integration with other personality assessment tools
- Historical editing (users cannot modify past quiz responses)
- Bulk question import/export for admins
