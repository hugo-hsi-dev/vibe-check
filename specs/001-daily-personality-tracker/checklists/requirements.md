# Specification Quality Checklist: Daily Personality Tracker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Results

**Validation Run 1** - 2025-10-17 (Initial specification)

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS

---

**Validation Run 2** - 2025-10-17 (Revision: Simplified to agree/disagree only)

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS

- ✅ No implementation details - spec focuses on WHAT (personality tracking, quiz flow) not HOW (no mention of specific tech stack)
- ✅ Focused on user value - emphasizes daily engagement, long-term personality insights, low friction
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders - uses plain language, MBTI terminology, business metrics
- ✅ All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions all present

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS

- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - all edge cases listed as open questions but not blocking
- ✅ Requirements are testable and unambiguous - each FR has clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable - includes specific metrics (60s completion, 70% D2 retention, 50% 7-day engagement)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic - focuses on user outcomes (completion time, retention) not system internals
- ✅ All acceptance scenarios are defined - Given/When/Then format for all 4 user stories
- ✅ Edge cases are identified - 7 edge cases covering partial completion, timezones, errors, question pool management
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded - "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes social features, mobile apps, premium features
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions identified - 10 assumptions documented (MBTI familiarity, UTC timezone, pre-loaded questions, etc.)

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS

- ✅ All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 25 FRs with explicit MUST statements
- ✅ User scenarios cover primary flows - 4 user stories covering quiz completion (P1), trends (P2), accounts (P1), admin (P3)
- ✅ Feature meets measurable outcomes - Success criteria align with user stories (quiz speed, retention, engagement)
- ✅ No implementation details leak - Entities section describes concepts (User, Question) without database schemas or code structure

### Overall Status: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with independent testability per story
- Comprehensive edge case identification
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Measurable success criteria focused on user outcomes
- Strong assumptions documentation

**Changes Made**:
- Updated input description to reflect agree/disagree only (removed neutral)
- Updated User Story 1 acceptance scenarios (removed neutral from button options)
- Updated FR-006 from "3 response options" to "2 response options"
- Updated Quiz Response entity description (removed neutral from answer options)
- Updated Performance Budgets FID description (removed neutral)
- Updated Accessibility touch targets description (removed neutral)
- Updated Assumptions (removed neutral from responses description)

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS

- ✅ No implementation details - still focused on WHAT (personality tracking) not HOW
- ✅ Focused on user value - simplified quiz reduces friction as intended
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders - plain language maintained
- ✅ All mandatory sections completed - no sections removed

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS

- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - all edge cases listed as open questions but not blocking
- ✅ Requirements are testable and unambiguous - FR-006 now explicitly states "2 response options"
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable - unchanged, still valid with binary choices
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic - no implementation details added
- ✅ All acceptance scenarios are defined - updated to reflect agree/disagree only
- ✅ Edge cases are identified - same 7 edge cases still apply
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded - Out of Scope section unchanged
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions identified - assumptions updated for binary responses

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS

- ✅ All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - FR-006 more precise now
- ✅ User scenarios cover primary flows - flows unchanged, only response options simplified
- ✅ Feature meets measurable outcomes - success criteria remain valid
- ✅ No implementation details leak - revision maintains abstraction level

### Overall Status: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass after revision. The simplification to agree/disagree only makes the spec cleaner and aligns with the goal of reducing friction.

**Key Improvements from Revision**:
- Clearer binary choice reduces decision paralysis
- Simpler UI with 2 buttons instead of 3
- More decisive personality scoring (no ambiguous neutral responses)
- Maintains all core functionality while reducing complexity

**Recommendations**:
- Consider using `/speckit.clarify` to address the 7 edge cases listed if you want explicit decisions before planning
- Otherwise, proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` - the revised spec is solid and ready for design phase
